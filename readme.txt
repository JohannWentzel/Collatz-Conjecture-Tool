COLLATZ.PY

A quick python tool to calculate all of the
numbers generated by the Collatz Conjecture.

The Collatz Conjecture states that, for any positive integer,
if the operations:

"If n is odd, n = 3n + 1. If n is even, n = n/2"

are run indefinitely, the n will eventually reach 1.
This script shows the correctness of that conjecture.

TO RUN:
